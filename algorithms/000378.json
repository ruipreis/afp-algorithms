    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is often associated with systemic manifestations. It affects about 2 percent of U.S. adults, and can significantly impact quality of life. The etiology includes genetic and environmental factors. Diagnosis is based on the typical erythematous, scaly skin lesions, often with additional manifestations in the nails and joints. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Atypical forms include guttate, pustular, erythrodermic, and inverse psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Topical therapies such as corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and tazarotene are useful for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. More severe psoriasis may be treated with phototherapy, or may require systemic therapy. Biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, can be effective for severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, but have significant adverse effect profiles and require regular monitoring. Management of psoriasis must be individualized and may involve combinations of different medications and phototherapy.",

No studies have directly compared individual topical corticosteroids, but systematic reviews concluded that more potent agents produce greater improvement in psoriasis symptoms.18Local adverse effects are common and include skin atrophy, irritation, and impaired wound healing. Systemic effects may also occur, especially with extended courses of high-potency agents.17Children are at increased risk of systemic effects because of their higher body surface areaâ€“to-weight ratio. Most treatment guidelines recommend gradually tapering topical corticosteroids after symptoms improve, but symptoms often return weeks to months after discontinuation. Many reports describe tachyphylaxis with topical corticosteroids. This may be genuine tolerance to treatment or the result of low adherence.16"
