    "abstract": "Although eye pain is often accompanied by redness or injection, pain can also occur with a quiet eye. Pain in a quiet eye can be the first sign of a vision-threatening condition, a more benign ophthalmologic condition, or a nonophthalmologic condition. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma is an emergent vision-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment and referral to an ophthalmologist. Although most nonophthalmologic conditions that cause eye pain do not need immediate treatment, giant cell (temporal) arteritis requires urgent treatment with corticosteroids. Other vascular conditions, such as carotid artery disease, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and transient ischemic attack or stroke, rarely cause eye pain but must be considered. Pain may also be referred from the sinuses or from neurologic conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and increased intracranial pressure. The differential diagnosis of eye pain in the quiet eye is extensive, necessitating a systematic and thorough approach.",

A history of similar pain that may have resolved spontaneously could suggest neurologic causes, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and cluster headaches, and transient ischemic attack. Palpation of the orbits and measurement of intraocular pressure can rule out narrow-angle glaucoma. Palpation of the temporal arteries should be performed next, because temporal arteritis is a relatively common cause of vision-threatening eye pain.Figure 1is an algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of pain in the quiet eye.1–3,11–19"

The annual incidence of narrow-angle glaucoma ranges from one to 30 per 1,000 persons, depending on age and ethnicity.1,20,21Persons with narrow-angle glaucoma classically present with headache or eye pain, vision changes, and nausea and vomiting. Although the eye is usually inflamed, inflammation may be absent. In persons with a shallow anterior chamber, the sudden increase in intraocular pressure may be precipitated by anything that dilates the pupil, such as anticholinergics, adrenergic stimulation, or dim lighting.22Although classic narrow-angle glaucoma is easy to identify, the variability in presentation and the possible absence or minimization of visual changes can make diagnosis difficult. Patients often describe having a visual halo, and subtle conjunctival injection or corneal edema may be noted on examination.2The affected pupil may be unreactive and mildly dilated. Referral to an ophthalmologist for definitive evaluation and treatment is warranted."

Patients with small foreign bodies or abrasions, however, may initially present with eye pain and only minimal injection.1,3Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) may produce severe pain due to the rich innervation of the cornea. Viral infections (e.g., herpes simplex virus), bacterial infections, exposure to ultraviolet light or chemicals, and inflammatory conditions can all cause keratitis.1Treatment of corneal abrasions typically includes oral analgesics and topical antibiotics, although corneal patching should be avoided.3,11,23,24If keratitis is suspected, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted."
