    "abstract": "Childhood constipation is common and almost always functional without an organic etiology. Stool retention can lead to fecal incontinence in some patients. Often, a medical history and physical examination are sufficient to diagnose functional constipation. Further evaluation for Hirschsprung disease, a spinal cord abnormality, or a metabolic disorder may be warranted in a child with red flags, such as onset before one month of age, delayed passage of meconium after birth, failure to thrive, explosive stools, and severe abdominal distension. Successful therapy requires prevention and treatment of fecal impaction, with oral laxatives or rectal therapies. Polyethylene glycolâ€“based solutions have become the mainstay of therapy, although other options, such as other osmotic or stimulant laxatives, are available. An increase in dietary fiber may improve the likelihood that laxatives can be discontinued in the future. Education is equally important as medical therapy and should include counseling families to recognize withholding behaviors; to use behavior interventions, such as regular toileting and reward systems; and to expect a chronic course with prolonged therapy, frequent relapses, and a need for close follow-up. Referral to a subspecialist is recommended only when there is concern for organic disease or when the constipation persists despite adequate therapy.",

To avoid the passage of another painful bowel movement, the child will contract the anal sphincter or gluteal muscles by stiffening his or her body, hiding in a corner, rocking back and forth, or fidgeting with each urge to defecate. Parents often confuse these withholding behaviors as straining to defecate. Withholding of stool can lead to prolonged fecal stasis in the colon with reabsorption of fluid, causing the stool to become harder, larger, and more painful to pass. Over time, as the rectum stretches to accommodate the retained fecal mass, rectal sensation decreases, and fecal incontinence may develop. This cycle commonly coincides with toilet training, changes in routine or diet, stressful events, illness, or lack of accessible toilets, or occurs in a busy child who defers defecation."

Hirschsprung disease is the most common cause of lower intestinal obstruction in neonates.
