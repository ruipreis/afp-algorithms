    "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections encountered by primary care physicians. Although UTIs do not occur with as great a frequency in children as in adults, they can be a source of significant morbidity in children. For reasons that are not yet completely understood, a minority of UTIs in children progress to renal scarring, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Clinical presentation of UTI in children may be nonspecific, and the appropriateness of certain diagnostic tests remains controversial. The diagnostic work-up should be tailored to uncover functional and structural abnormalities such as dysfunctional voiding, vesicoureteral reflux and obstructive uropathy. A more aggressive work-up, including renal cortical scintigraphy, ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography, is recommended for patients at greater risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring, including infants less than one year of age and all children who have systemic signs of infection concomitant with a UTI. Antibiotic prophylaxis is used in patients with reflux or recurrent UTI who are at greater risk for subsequent infections and complications.",

Other pathogens include Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, a variety of enterobacteria (e.g., Klebsiella, Proteus) and, occasionally,Candida albicans. The virulence of the invading bacteria and the susceptibility of the host are of primary importance in the development of UTI.3In neonates, the usual route of infection is presumed to be hematogenous.1Later in life, infection is usually caused by ascension of bacteria into the urinary tract.5Any condition that leads to urinary stasis (renal calculi, obstructive uropathy, vesicoureteral reflux and voiding disorders) may predispose to the development of UTI in children.5Renal parenchymal infection and scarring are well-established complications of infection of the upper urinary tract in children and can lead to renal insufficiency, hypertension and renal failure. Parenchymal scarring develops in 10 to 15 percent of children with UTI. Children less than one year of age with a UTI are at much greater risk for renal scarring than older children; children over five years of age uncommonly have new renal scarring with UTI.6A 27-year follow-up study from Sweden1showed that focal renal scarring caused by pyelonephritis in a child carried a 23 percent risk for hypertension and a 10 percent risk for end-stage renal disease."

While some researchers emphasize the risk of renal scarring from recurrent UTI without reflux,10others are just as adamant regarding the risk of scarring from reflux in the absence of infection.11The fact that renal scarring develops in only a minority of patients with pyelonephritis and/or vesicoureteral reflux suggests that the development of renal scarring likely involves the interplay of several factors and cannot simply be attributed to the presence of infection or reflux alone(Figure 1)."
