    "abstract": "The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.",

An average 132-lb (60-kg) woman might lose an extra 10 mg of iron per menstruation cycle, but the loss could be more than 42 mg per cycle depending on how heavily she menstruates.7A pregnancy takes about 700 mg of iron, and a whole blood donation of 500 cc contains 250 mg of iron."

Absorption can increase three- to fivefold in states of depletion. Dietary iron is available in two forms: heme iron, which is found in meat; and nonheme iron, which is found in plant and dairy foods. Absorption of heme iron is minimally affected by dietary factors, whereas nonheme iron makes up the bulk of consumed iron. The bioavailability of non-heme iron requires acid digestion and varies by an order of magnitude depending on the concentration of enhancers (e.g., ascorbate, meat) and inhibitors (e.g., calcium, fiber, tea, coffee, wine) found in the diet.7"

Red blood cells in IDA are usually described as being microcytic (i.e., mean corpuscular volume less than 80 Î¼m3[80 fL]) and hypochromic, however the manifestation of iron deficiency occurs in several stages.24Patients with a serum ferritin concentration less than 25 ng per mL (25 mcg per L) have a very high probability of being iron deficient. The most accurate initial diagnostic test for IDA is the serum ferritin measurement. Serum ferritin values greater than 100 ng per mL (100 mcg per L) indicate adequate iron stores and a low likelihood of IDA(Table 425,26).25In some populations, such as those with inflammatory disease or cirrhosis, these tests must be interpreted slightly differently because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant. Cutoffs for abnormality in these patients generally are higher.27"

The amount of iron available to bind to this molecule is reduced, causing a decrease in the transferrin saturation and an increase in the total iron-binding capacity. The serum transferrin receptor assay is a newer approach to measuring iron status at the cellular level. Increased levels are found in patients with IDA, and normal levels are found in patients with anemia of chronic disease.28"

This algorithm is adapted from a clinical guideline, with the primary modification that serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and transferrin saturation are recommended as follow-up tests in patients with an intermediate ferritin level as a strategy to reduce the need for bone marrow biopsy.29If these blood tests are indeterminate, an elevated serum transferrin receptor level is recommended to distinguish IDA from anemia of chronic disease. The choice of a ferritin level of less than 45 ng per mL (45 mcg per L) is to allow for a higher sensitivity, despite the fact that most laboratories' normal range for ferritin includes 45 ng per mL."

However, oral iron therapy is usually the first-line therapy for patients with IDA.34As noted in the etiology section, iron absorption varies widely based on type of diet and other factors. Bone marrow response to iron is limited to 20 mg per day of elemental iron. An increase in the hemoglobin level of 1 g per dL (10 g per L) should occur every two to three weeks on iron therapy; however, it may take up to four months for the iron stores to return to normal after the hemoglobin has corrected.35Ferrous sulfate in a dose of 325 mg provides 65 mg of elemental iron, whereas 325 mg of ferrous gluconate provides 38 mg of elemental iron. Sustained-release formulations of iron are not recommended as initial therapy because they reduce the amount of iron that is presented for absorption to the duodenal villi."

This can be accomplished through simultaneous intake of ascorbic acid (i.e., vitamin C).36Although iron absorption occurs more readily when taken on an empty stomach, this increases the likelihood of stomach upset because of iron therapy. Increased patient adherence should be weighed against the inferior absorption. Foods rich in tannates (e.g., tea)37or phytates (e.g., bran, cereal),38or medications that raise the gastric pH (e.g., antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H2blockers)39reduce absorption and should be avoided if possible. Some persons have difficulty absorbing the iron because of poor dissolution of the coating.40A liquid iron preparation would be a better choice for these patients. Laxatives, stool softeners, and adequate intake of liquids can alleviate the constipating effects of oral iron therapy."

The advantage of iron dextran is the ability to administer large doses (200 to 500 mg) at one time.42One major drawback of iron dextran is the risk of anaphylactic reactions that can be fatal. There also is a delayed reaction, which consists of myalgias, headache, and arthralgias, that can occur 24 to 48 hours after infusion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will usually relieve these symptoms, but they may be prolonged in patients with chronic inflammatory joint disease."
