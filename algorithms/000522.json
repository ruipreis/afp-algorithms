(Level of Evidence: A)The 2009 recommendation was updated to clarify that cardiac resynchronization therapy may be indicated for patients with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Evidence shows that cardiac resynchronization therapy can improve symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life, LVEF, and survival; it can also decrease hospitalizations in patients with persistently symptomatic heart failure receiving optimal medical therapy who have cardiac dyssynchrony.

There were equivalent outcomes for restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm by electrical or pharmacologic conversion compared with controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Optimal dosing of diuretics should produce a rate of diuresis that will benefit volume status and relieve signs and symptoms of congestion without inducing an excessively rapid reduction in intravascular volume, possibly resulting in hypotension, renal dysfunction, or both. Limiting sodium intake and dosing the diuretic multiple times daily can enhance diuresis effectiveness. Patients who present with congestion and moderate to severe renal dysfunction may have a blunted response to diuretics, requiring higher initial doses.

These medications are most beneficial in patients with relative hypotension and who have intolerance or no response to vasodilators and diuretics. However, the use of inotropes indicates a poor prognosis, and a thorough hemodynamic assessment is necessary. There is no evidence of benefit for routine use of these agents in patients with acute heart failure caused by congestion only; therefore, inotropes should be limited to carefully selected patients with low blood pressure and reduced cardiac output, who will require close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rhythm."
