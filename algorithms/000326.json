    "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as intermittent urinary incontinence during sleep in a child at least five years of age. Approximately 5% to 10% of all seven-year-olds have enuresis, and an estimated 5 to 7 million children in the United States have enuresis. The pathophysiology of primary nocturnal enuresis involves the inability to awaken from sleep in response to a full bladder, coupled with excessive nighttime urine production or a decreased functional capacity of the bladder. Initial evaluation should include a history, physical examination, and urinalysis. Several conditions, such as constipation, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, chronic kidney disease, and psychiatric disorders, are associated with enuresis. If identified, these conditions should be evaluated and treated. Treatment of primary monosymptomatic enuresis (i.e., the only symptom is nocturnal bed-wetting in a child who has never been dry) begins with counseling the child and parents on effective behavioral modifications. First-line treatments for enuresis include bed alarm therapy and desmopressin. The choice of therapy is based on the child's age and nighttime voiding patterns, and the desires of the child and family. Referral to a pediatric urologist is indicated for children with primary enuresis refractory to standard and combination therapies, and for children with some secondary causes of enuresis, including urinary tract malformations, recurrent urinary tract infections, or neurologic disorders.",

They should also ask about daytime lower urinary tract symptoms, because these may not be volunteered by the child or parents who are focused on the bed-wetting. A sense of the child's and parents' concerns about the bed-wetting should be determined, as well as their motivation and desire for treatment.Table 1provides a list of questions and the clinical responses to the answers.2,6,8,11–13A bladder diary can be used to assess nighttime voiding patterns, urine output, and daytime drinking habits.

In addition, bladder ultrasonography is useful in measuring rectal diameter when investigating for constipation.

Full-spectrum therapy is a more comprehensive approach that includes bed alarm therapy, cleanliness training, bladder training, and overlearning, which involves having the child drink extra at night after 14 consecutive dry nights are achieved. These interventions are more effective when used in conjunction with a bed alarm, suggesting that much of their benefit is derived from the alarm.29Negative consequences for wetting should be avoided.30"

Bed alarms include a moisture sensor, placed on the child's undergarments or as a pad underneath the child, which is connected by wire or wirelessly to an alarm that signals a loud, acoustic stimulus when wetness is detected. The goal is for the child to awaken at the beginning of an enuresis episode, stop urinating temporarily, shut off the alarm, go to the toilet, and finish urinating. Alarms that give an electric shock are generally not acceptable to patients or parents."

After a bed alarm is initiated, follow-up should occur at four weeks to assess for response and compliance, troubleshoot any technical difficulties, and answer any questions.
