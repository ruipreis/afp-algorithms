    "abstract": "Spirometry is a powerful tool that can be used to detect, follow, and manage patients with lung disorders. Technology advancements have made spirometry much more reliable and relatively simple to incorporate into a routine office visit. However, interpreting spirometry results can be challenging because the quality of the test is largely dependent on patient effort and cooperation, and the interpreter's knowledge of appropriate reference values. A simplified and stepwise method is key to interpreting spirometry. The first step is determining the validity of the test. Next, the determination of an obstructive or restrictive ventilatory patten is made. If a ventilatory pattern is identified, its severity is graded. In some patients, additional tests such as static lung volumes, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, and bronchodilator challenge testing are needed. These tests can further define lung processes but require more sophisticated equipment and expertise available only in a pulmonary function laboratory.",

Normal lungs generally can empty more than 80 percent of their volume in six seconds or less. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is the volume of air exhaled in the first second of the FVC maneuver. The FEV1/FVC ratio is expressed as a percentage (e.g., FEV1of 0.5 L divided by FVC of 2.0 L gives an FEV1/FVC ratio of 25 percent). The absolute ratio is the value used in interpretation, not the percent predicted."

The parameter is based on a six-second maneuver, which incorporates a standard time frame to decrease patient variability and the risk of complications. One of the pitfalls of using this type of spirometer is that it must be calibrated for temperature and water vapor. It should be used with caution in patients with advanced COPD because of its inability to detect very low volumes or flows. However, the FEV1/FEV6ratio provides accurate surrogate measure for the FEV1/FVC ratio.12The reported FEV1and FEV6values should be rounded to the nearest 0.1 L and the percent predicted and the FEV1/FEV6ratio to the nearest integer.13"

FEV1 and FVC are greater in whites compared with blacks and Asians. FVC and VC values vary with the position of the patient. These variables can be 7 to 8 percent greater in patients who are sitting during the test compared with patients who are supine.

When the FVC and FEV1are decreased, the distinction between an obstructive and restrictive ventilatory pattern depends on the absolute FEV1/FVC ratio. If the absolute FEV1/FVC ratio is normal or increased, a restrictive ventilatory impairment may be present. However, to make a definitive diagnosis of restrictive lung disease, the patient should be referred to a pulmonary laboratory for static lung volumes. If the TLC is less than 80 percent, the pattern is restrictive, and diseases such as pleural effusion, pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, and congestive heart failure should be considered."
