    "abstract": "Acute pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, is found in approximately 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction. It occurs most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. Acute pericarditis has a number of potential etiologies including infection, acute myocardial infarction, medication use, trauma to the thoracic cavity, and systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, most etiologic evaluations are inconclusive. Patients with acute pericarditis commonly present with acute, sharp, retrosternal chest pain that is relieved by sitting or leaning forward. A pericardial friction rub is found in up to 85% of patients. Classic electrocardiographic changes include widespread concave upward ST-segment elevation without reciprocal T-wave inversions or Q waves. First-line treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. Glucocorticoids are traditionally reserved for severe or refractory cases, or in cases when the cause of pericarditis is likely connective tissue disease, autoreactivity, or uremia. Cardiology consultation is recommended for patients with severe disease, those with pericarditis refractory to empiric treatment, and those with unclear etiologies.",

It is diagnosed in approximately 0.1% of patients hospitalized for chest pain and in 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction (MI).1Although acute pericarditis occurs in all age groups and in men and women, it presents most often in men 20 to 50 years of age.2Acute pericarditis by itself confers low mortality; however, the high rate of recurrence and the difficulty of controlling symptoms contribute to high morbidity. After an initial episode of acute pericarditis, 30% of patients have a recurrence.3Factors associated with increased morbidity are shown inTable 1.4â€“6"

About 15 to 50 mL of fluid, an ultrafiltrate of plasma, separates these layers. Acute pericarditis can result from a systemic disease or a process isolated to the pericardium(Table 2).2,7,8In most immunocompetent patients, viral or idiopathic etiologies are common, but other causes must be considered.9Localized to the heart, acute pericarditis can occur secondary to an MI or a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Systemic conditions, such as malignancy, inflammatory responses, autoimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and uremia, can precipitate acute pericarditis. External causes other than viral infections include pharmacologic agents (e.g., hydralazine, isoniazid), radiation treatment, blunt or sharp trauma to the thoracic cavity, and bacterial infection.9Most etiologic evaluations are inconclusive."

In contrast to the pain from myocardial ischemia, chest pain from acute pericarditis is exacerbated in the supine position, by coughing, and with inspiration. The pain usually improves in the seated position or by leaning forward, which reduces pressure on the parietal pericardium, but it is not relieved with nitrates.2Acute chest pain may or may not occur in patients with uremic pericarditis or pericarditis associated with rheumatologic disorders, although pleuritic chest pain may be the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dull, oppressive chest pain radiating to the trapezius ridges or shoulders may occur with acute pericarditis, making it difficult to differentiate from other common or life-threatening causes of chest pain, such as MI or aortic dissection(Tables 311and49)."

The intensity of the friction rub may be increased during auscultation by having the patient lean forward or rest the elbows on the knees, applying firm pressure on the stethoscope diaphragm during suspended respiration.9Respiration does not affect a pericardial friction rub and thus allows differentiation from a pleural rub."

Toward the end of the taper (generally six to eight weeks), NSAIDs or colchicine can be introduced to decrease the risk of recurrence.6The taper is based on clinical symptoms and serum biomarkers.
