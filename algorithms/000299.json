    "abstract": "Skin and soft tissue infections result from microbial invasion of the skin and its supporting structures. Management is determined by the severity and location of the infection and by patient comorbidities. Infections can be classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or nonnecrotizing), or as suppurative or nonsuppurative. Most community-acquired infections are caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureusand beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Simple infections are usually monomicrobial and present with localized clinical findings. In contrast, complicated infections can be mono- or polymicrobial and may present with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation. Laboratory testing may be required to confirm an uncertain diagnosis, evaluate for deep infections or sepsis, determine the need for inpatient care, and evaluate and treat comorbidities. Initial antimicrobial choice is empiric, and in simple infections should coverStaphylococcusandStreptococcusspecies. Patients with complicated infections, including suspected necrotizing fasciitis and gangrene, require empiric polymicrobial antibiotic coverage, inpatient treatment, and surgical consultation for debridement. Superficial and small abscesses respond well to drainage and seldom require antibiotics. Immunocompromised patients require early treatment and antimicrobial coverage for possible atypical organisms.",

The infection may also originate from an adjacent site or from embolic spread from a distant site.S. aureusand streptococci are responsible for most simple community-acquired SSTIs. In one prospective study, beta-hemolytic streptococcus was found to cause nearly three-fourths of cases of diffuse cellulitis.16S. aureus,P. aeruginosa, enterococcus, andEscherichia coliare the predominant organisms isolated from hospitalized patients with SSTIs.17MRSA infections are characterized by liquefaction of infected tissue and abscess formation; the resulting increase in tissue tension causes ischemia and overlying skin necrosis. Lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination causes septicemia and spread to other organs (e.g., lung, bone, heart valves). Diabetic lower limb infections, severe hospital-acquired infections, necrotizing infections, and head and hand infections pose higher risks of mortality and functional disability.9"
