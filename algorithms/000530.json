    "abstract": "Von Willebrand disease is an inherited condition characterized by deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which is essential in hemostasis. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has released new evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the disease. There are three major subtypes of von Willebrand disease, classified as partial quantitative deficiency (low levels) of von Willebrand factor (type 1), qualitative deficiency (type 2), or virtually complete deficiency (type 3). Diagnosis is usually made by reviewing the patient's personal and family history of bleeding and by clinical evaluation for more common reasons for bleeding, supplemented with laboratory tests. Assessment may be used to determine bleeding risk before surgery and other invasive procedures, and to diagnose reasons for unexplained hemorrhaging. Von Willebrand factor levels of 30 IU per dL or lower are required for the definite diagnosis of inherited von Willebrand disease. Persons with levels of 30 to 50 IU per dL may not have the disease, but may need agents to increase von Willebrand factor levels during invasive procedures or childbirth. Treatment is tailored to the subtype of the disease: increasing plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor by releasing endogenous stores with desmopressin or replacing nonexistent or ineffective von Willebrand factor by using human plasmaâ€“derived, viral-inactivated concentrates; treatment is often combined with hemostatic agents that have mechanisms other than increasing von Willebrand factor. Regular prophylaxis is seldom required, and treatment is initiated before planned invasive procedures or in response to bleeding.",

The disease leads to bleeding from impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation, and may be accompanied by a reduced concentration of factor VIII. Undiagnosed VWD likely accounts for many women with menorrhagia and patients with mild to moderate hemorrhage during or after invasive procedures. In screening assessments of large asymptomatic populations, the prevalence of VWD has been reported to be as high as 1.3 percent. However, only about 0.01 percent of the population had clinically recognized symptoms associated with abnormal VWD test results.1Of note, average VWF levels are 25 percent lower in persons with type O blood compared with others in the ABO blood group, and many inflammatory conditions and pregnancy increase VWF levels, confounding the diagnosis.2It is important for family physicians to know when to suspect VWD, to know how to evaluate for the disease, and to understand the principles of management. This article summarizes recent evidence-based guidelines on the diagnosis and management of VWD from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).3-5"

Most bleeding is mild to moderate and does not require transfusion or prompt a physician visit, making it difficult to separate normal bleeding from that associated with mild VWD.12Although menorrhagia is common in women, those with VWD are more likely to have more marked menorrhagia with blood clots greater than 1 inch in diameter, bleeding that requires a pad or tampon change more than hourly, and low serum ferritin levels.13"

The initial hemostasis evaluation should include complete blood and platelet counts, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and possibly fibrinogen level or thrombin time.5,6,8These tests can exclude other bleeding problems, such as isolated low platelet counts from thrombocytopenic disorders, isolated prolongation of prothrombin time from warfarin use, and low fibrinogen levels from diffuse intravascular coagulation or sepsis. These coagulation factor abnormalities are unlikely to be caused by VWD and require other hematologic assessment. Bleeding time testing is no longer recommended to screen for bleeding disorders.3"
