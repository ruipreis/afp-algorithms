High-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended in children and adults with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis who live in regions with an endemic rate of 10 percent or more of invasive penicillin-nonsusceptibleStreptococcus pneumoniae; those with severe infection; children who attend day care; persons younger than two years or older than 65 years; those recently hospitalized; those who have used antibiotics within the previous month; and those who are immunocompromised[weak, moderate].

Although second- and third-generation oral cephalosporins are not recommended for empiric mono-therapy, third-generation agents (i.e., cefixime [Suprax] or cefpodoxime) plus clindamycin may be considered for second-line therapy in children with non–type I penicillin allergy or from regions with high endemic rates of penicillin-nonsusceptibleS. pneumoniae [weak, moderate]."

Endoscopically guided cultures of the middle meatus may be used as an alternative method in adults; however, they should not be used in children because their reliability has not been determined[weak, moderate].
