    "abstract": "The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.",

The updated guideline was developed in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and published in 2008.2The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. This review summarizes the key recommendations as they apply to the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), acute management of STEMI, and secondary prevention of recurrent events. As always, the values and preferences of patients, and sound clinical judgment are of paramount importance in applying guideline recommendations."

The consensus opinion is that a risk factor assessment for CHD should be performed every three to five years in all patients. Risk factors include smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, family history, age, and sex. In patients with two or more major risk factors, calculation of a 10-year coronary artery disease risk score is recommended to assess the need for primary prevention.3The risk score can also be an effective tool to start a dialogue with patients about lifestyle change."

            "text": "Time is of the essence in the acute management of STEMI. It is important that family physicians educate patients about the symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) and instruct them to seek help immediately if these symptoms occur. Patients who have been prescribed nitroglycerin should take one dose sublingually at the onset of symptoms; if they do not improve or if they worsen within five minutes, they should seek medical attention. Once symptoms are recognized, patients should chew aspirin (162 to 325 mg) unless there is an absolute contraindication. At the community level, clear protocols must exist to minimize the time to transport the patient to the appropriate facility. Emergency medical service (EMS) providers should be trained and equipped to provide early defibrillation. In the prehospital setting, advanced cardiac life support-trained health care professionals should obtain 12-lead electrocardiography. Pre-hospital fibrinolysis protocols are reasonable if the EMS system is appropriately trained and staffed."

The most important point in managing STEMI is minimizing the time from the onset of symptoms until the initiation of reperfusion therapy (fibrinolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]). The goal is for fibrinolysis to begin less than 30 minutes from the time of the patient's first contact with the health care system, or for balloon inflation for PCI to begin in less than 90 minutes."

Patients with MI with ST-segment depression should not be treated with fibrinolysis unless they have a true posterior MI. Primary PCI is preferred to fibrinolysis only in highâ€“PCI-volume hospitals (i.e., those with more than 36 procedures per year). If patients cannot reach such a facility within the required 90 minutes, they should receive fibrinolysis unless contraindicated."

Patients with contraindications to fibrinolysis should be immediately transported to such a facility, or transferred within 30 minutes.

More study is required before clear recommendations can be made on other facilitated strategies (i.e., half-dose fibrinolysis, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, or both). These strategies may be considered when patients are at high risk and PCI is not available within 90 minutes, provided bleeding risk is low (i.e., in younger patients and those with normal body weight, and in the absence of poorly controlled hypertension). Rescue PCI after failed thrombolysis is still appropriate and should be performed in patients who fail fibrinolysis, as evidenced by shock, severe CHF or pulmonary edema (Killip class III or greater), or hemodynamically compromising ventricular arrhythmias. Rescue PCI is reasonable in patients who have less than 50 percent resolution of ST-segment elevation 90 minutes after initiation of fibrinolytic therapy and a moderately large area of myocardium at risk."

The update contains new recommendations that do not pertain to aspirin, which has a clear benefit in these patients. Patients who routinely took NSAIDs (nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2] selective agents) before STEMI should discontinue those agents because of the increased risk of mortality, reinfarction, hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial rupture associated with their use. These drugs should not be administered during hospitalization for STEMI."

The update recommends that 75 mg of oral clopidogrel be added to daily aspirin, whether or not the patient underwent reperfusion; this change is summarized inTable 2.1Treatment with clopidogrel should continue for at least 14 days. Long-term maintenance therapy (e.g., one year) may be useful in these patients. It is reasonable to start clopidogrel therapy with a 300-mg oral loading dose in patients younger than 75 years; no data are available for older patients. In patients with baremetal stents, clopidogrel should be continued for at least one month; it should be continued for several months in patients with drug-eluting stents (at least three months for sirolimus [Rapamune], six months for paclitaxel [Taxol]) and 12 months in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding. The guideline update does not address whether longer-term clopidogrel therapy is needed in patients with drug-eluting stents."

In patients with intolerable persistent discomfort, NSAIDs with increasing degrees of relative COX-2 selectivity may be considered.
