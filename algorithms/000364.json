Dermoscopy, also known as dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy, incident light microscopy, or skin surface microscopy, is performed using a handheld instrument called a dermatoscope or dermoscope, which has a transilluminating light source and standard magnifying optics (10×). The dermatoscope facilitates visualization of subsurface skin structures located within the epidermis, dermoepidermal junction, and papillary dermis, which are otherwise not visible to the unaided eye.1,2"

Dermatoscopes illuminate the skin via the use of light-emitting diode bulbs, with or without the use of polarizing filters. Dermatoscopes using nonpolarized light require direct contact between the skin and the scope, and require a liquid interface, such as ultrasound gel or alcohol, to be placed between the skin and glass plate of the dermatoscope.12"

The liquid interface prevents light from being reflected off the stratum corneum and improves refraction, thereby allowing the visualization of structures below the stratum corneum. Dermatoscopes equipped with cross-polarized filters obviate the need for direct skin contact and a liquid interface.13Cross-polarized filters eliminate the glare off the skin surface and increase light refraction, allowing the observer to visualize deeper skin structures."

Even if the two-step algorithm cannot reliably differentiate between melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions, it has been structured to ensure that cutaneous malignancies will not be missed.36,39For example, occasionally basal cell carcinoma and melanoma can manifest overlapping features that may lead to the incorrect classification of some basal cell carcinomas as melanocytic (i.e., melanoma) and some melanomas as nonmelanocytic (i.e., basal cell carcinoma). Despite this potential error, the concern for a cutaneous malignancy will remain high, and the management decision to perform a biopsy will not be altered."

Dermoscopic asymmetry requires further clarification, because it differs from the conventional way that clinicians define asymmetry. The conventional view of asymmetry, as in the well-known ABCD mnemonic for melanoma (asymmetry, border irregularities, color variation, diameter [greater than 6 mm]), factors in the contour or shape of the lesion. In contrast, symmetry or asymmetry in dermoscopy does not factor in the contour or shape, but rather the distribution of colors and structures within the lesion(Figure 8). For example, using the conventional definition of symmetry, a heart-shaped lesion that reveals only globules would be considered asymmetric in one axis; however, under dermoscopy, this lesion would be considered completely symmetric in both axes."

During the final stages of production, we discovered that Dr. Marghoob had the following relationships with makers of dermoscopes, which we agreed should be disclosed: (1) receiving dermoscope prototypes for testing from the four major manufacturers, and providing unpaid feedback and advice about these devices; (2) receiving honoraria for speaking on the topic of dermoscopy at meetings funded in part by makers of dermoscopes (however, Dr. Marghoob is not on any speakers' bureaus); and (3) being an investigator in Institutional Review Board–approved research projects funded by the National Institutes of Health and Melanoma Research Alliance, some of which partnered (at least to some extent) with companies that produce dermoscopes (however, Dr. Marghoob does not receive any compensation from this grant funding). Given the stage at which these conflicts came to our attention, we performed an internal review of the manuscript and disclosures, and ultimately decided that the manuscript provided an unbiased and nonpromotional description of this technique. In addition, Dr. Marghoob agreed to not enter into any relationships with a maker of dermoscopes that used hisAFParticle for any presentations on dermoscopy for at least 12 months after the article's publication. For these reasons, we decided to continue with publication. However, to be clear, relationships like these would generally be disqualifying according to our conflict of interest policy (https://www.aafp.org/journals/afp/authors/guide/coi.html)."
