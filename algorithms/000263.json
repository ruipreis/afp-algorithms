    "abstract": "Bleeding and bruising are common symptoms in the primary care setting. The patient history can help determine whether the bruising or bleeding is abnormal. The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis has developed a bleeding assessment tool that can be used to indicate possible pathology. A family history of bleeding problems may suggest a hereditary coagulation defect. Such a history is especially important in children who may not have experienced a major bleeding episode. Medication review can identify pharmacologic causes of the bleeding or bruising. Physical examination findings such as mucocutaneous bleeding suggest that the underlying condition is caused by platelet dysfunction, whereas hemarthroses or hematomas are more common in coagulopathy. If the history and physical examination findings suggest a bleeding diathesis, initial laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). A normal PT and PTT indicate a platelet disorder, the most common of which is von Willebrand disease. A normal PT and prolonged PTT signal a deficit in the intrinsic pathway, and a mixing study should be performed. A vitamin K challenge is indicated in patients with an abnormal PT and normal PTT. A workup for liver failure is warranted in patients with prolonged PT and PTT. If initial testing does not reveal an etiology in a patient with a high suspicion for a bleeding disorder, the patient should be referred to a hematologist for additional evaluation.",

It is important to ask about several generations and second-degree relations, such as maternal uncles, when hemophilia is suspected in a male. However, a negative family history does not exclude a genetically inherited disorder; up to one-third of patients diagnosed with hemophilia have no family history.16Similarly, a negative family history does not preclude someone from having von Willebrand disease, because incomplete penetrance and variable expression contribute to the complexity of inheritance. Obtaining a thorough family history is especially important in children because they may not have challenged their clotting system with surgery or dental procedures."

Some medications may be clinically indicated despite increased bleeding and bruising (e.g., clopidogrel [Plavix] after coronary stenting). Physicians must discuss the risks and benefits of these medications with patients. Additional evaluation is warranted if a medication is suspected as the cause of bleeding and bruising, but symptoms persist beyond seven to 10 days despite discontinuation of the medication. Antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents most commonly cause bleeding or bruising. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia should be suspected when the platelet count rebounds after discontinuation of the drug in question and decreases with reexposure to the drug.17Although low platelet counts can occur in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (an immune-based thrombocytopenia), the major complication is thrombosis rather than bleeding."

Therefore, further evaluation should focus on platelet function activity. Bleeding time is no longer considered the test of choice because it is labor intensive and has poor sensitivity and specificity. The platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), developed in the 1990s, automates the process of determining platelet aggregation by passing the patient's blood through two membranes. Although the PFA-100 can detect severe forms of von Willebrand disease, it may miss milder, more common forms of the condition, with a sensitivity of only 61.5% to 71%.20Additionally, the PFA-100 has variable sensitivity for detecting platelet function abnormalities (24% to 81%).22,23Therefore, it is not recommended by the ISTH as a screening tool for von Willebrand disease or platelet function disorders.21"

This can be carried out by a hematologist, if desired.

The PTT generally corrects after mixing and stays corrected after incubation if there is a clotting deficiency, but will prolong after incubation if there is a clotting inhibitor.
