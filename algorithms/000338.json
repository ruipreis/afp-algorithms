    "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affects nearly 75% of pregnant women. The exact cause is unknown. In most cases, it is a mild, self-limited condition that can be controlled with conservative measures and has no adverse fetal sequelae. About 1% of women develop hyper-emesis gravidarum, which may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and fetus. Patients with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy should be evaluated for other causes, particularly if symptoms are unremitting or presentation is atypical. Initial treatment is conservative and includes dietary changes, emotional support, and vitamin B6supplementation. Several safe and effective pharmacologic therapies are available for women who do not improve with initial treatment. Women with hyperemesis gravidarum may require more aggressive interventions, including hospitalization, rehydration therapy, and parenteral nutrition.",

However, observational data indicate that these conditions correlate with levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the size of the placental mass, which suggests that placental products may be associated with the presence and severity of nausea and vomiting.11Some women with complete hydatidiform molar pregnancies, in which no fetus is present, have significant nausea and vomiting, which indicates that placental factors, particularly hCG, are responsible. Women with higher hCG levels, such as those with multiple gestations, hydatidiform moles, or fetuses with Down syndrome, are at increased risk of nausea and vomiting.12"
