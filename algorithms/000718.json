    "abstract": "Physicians most often recommend or prescribe oral medication for relief of acute pain. This review of the available evidence supports the use of acetaminophen in doses up to 1,000 mg as the initial choice for mild to moderate acute pain. In some cases, modest improvements in analgesic efficacy can be achieved by adding or changing to a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The safest NSAID is ibuprofen in doses of 400 mg. Higher doses may offer somewhat greater analgesia but with more adverse effects. Other NSAIDs have failed to demonstrate consistently greater efficacy or safety than ibuprofen. Although they may be more expensive, these alternatives may be chosen for their more convenient dosing. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors provide equivalent efficacy to traditional NSAIDs but lack a demonstrable safety advantage for the treatment of acute pain. For more severe acute pain, the evidence supports the addition of oral narcotic medications such as hydrocodone, morphine, or oxycodone. Specific oral analgesics that have shown poor efficacy and side effects include codeine, propoxyphene, and tramadol.",

An even greater number of persons are likely to have acute pain at any one time.1Unfortunately, considerable confusion exists about the efficacy and safety of commonly used analgesics. This review provides a survey of the best available evidence regarding oral analgesia for acute pain, which is defined as pain associated with new tissue injury that typically lasts less than one month, but at times for as long as six months.2Acute pain generally does not involve the long-term, daily use of analgesics."

The concept of number needed to treat (NNT) is a particularly helpful way to convey this outcome. It refers to the number of patients who have to use the treatment for one patient to benefit. For example, when acetaminophen is said to have an NNT of four compared with placebo, it means that for every four patients who take acetaminophen instead of placebo, at least one patient will experience a 50 percent decrease in pain. The other three patients may have a significant decrease in pain (e.g., 40 or 30 percent), but this is not reflected in the NNT. The lower the NNT, the greater the likelihood that a given patient will achieve a 50 percent reduction in pain.3Other measures of pain relief include average decreases on visual analog scales and functional outcome measures. A visual analog scale is a 100-mm line with no pain at one end and severe pain at the other. For meaningful analgesia of acute pain, patients must report at least a 13-mm difference between analgesic choices.4,5"

Most of the analgesic effects of NSAIDs have been attributed to their COX-2 inhibition, while their undesirable side effects have been attributed to their inhibition of COX-1 enzymes. In recent years, three new oral prescription medications (celecoxib [Celebrex], rofecoxib [Vioxx], and valdecoxib [Bextra]) have been marketed in the United States; they selectively inhibit COX-2 enzymes without inhibiting COX-1 enzymes. Theoretically, these medications could provide analgesia equal to that of traditional NSAIDs without many of the side effects. A meta-analysis of the oldest COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, showed fair to good efficacy for postoperative pain with an NNT of 4.5 (95 percent CI, 3.3 to 7.2) compared with placebo.22In several RCTs,23â€“26rofecoxib has shown good analgesic efficacy for some acute pain conditions (e.g., joint replacement surgery, dysmenorrhea), but not for others (e.g., tonsillectomy, prostate biopsy). Valdecoxib (20 mg and 40 mg) has been effective for acute postoperative pain of wisdom tooth extraction with an NNT of 1.6 to 1.7.27Valdecoxib also has demonstrated analgesia superior to that of placebo in postoperative knee surgery.28Comparative trials have confirmed that COX-2 inhibitors are no more or less effective than NSAIDs."

One RCT32found that dosages of 10 mg per day or less produce fewer endoscopically detected ulcers than naproxen (500 mg twice per day). Higher-dosage valdecoxib (20 mg per day) produced numbers of endoscopic ulcers similar to naproxen. In another trial,33valdecoxib (10 mg and 20 mg per day) produced fewer endoscopic ulcers than high-dose NSAIDs (800 mg of ibuprofen three times per day or 75 mg of diclofenac twice per day). Despite trials showing decreased endoscopic ulcers, no data have shown a decrease in meaningful or serious adverse effects with valdecoxib versus other NSAIDs. As with traditional NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors may impair renal function and have no benefit over NSAIDs in this area.34Initiation of COX-2 inhibitors in elderly patients with hypertension may be associated with significant edema and increased blood pressure. This is seen particularly with rofecoxib.35"

No substantial evidence supports the notion that any other narcotic has greater efficacy or fewer side effects than morphine (Duramorph). Regular oral morphine takes one hour to work while sustained-release formulations may take two to four hours. Although use of oral morphine plays a role in the treatment of chronic pain, oral narcotic treatment of acute pain most often involves codeine, propoxyphene (Darvon), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and oxycodone (Roxicodone). Hydrocodone generally is considered the most potent oral narcotic analgesic that does not require specialized prescribing documentation. However, no literature compares hydrocodone with other oral narcotics. The results of one RCT36found that hydrocodone in a dose of 15 mg with 400 mg of ibuprofen is significantly better than 400 mg of ibuprofen alone for postoperative pain. Another trial37found that the combination of 7.5 mg of hydrocodone and 750 mg of acetaminophen was highly effective for the relief of acute pain.37Single-dose oral oxycodone, with or without acetaminophen, appears to be comparable in efficacy to intramuscular morphine and NSAIDs. Side effects are similar to other narcotics.38"

For the combination of propoxyphene and acetaminophen (650 mg), the NNT was 4.4 (95 percent CI, 3.5 to 5.6) when compared with placebo, similar to the NNT for acetaminophen alone.

While clinical trials have failed to show that any one narcotic has fewer side effects than another in the population as a whole, persons vary greatly with regard to their tolerance for narcotic side effects. Tolerance and physical dependence can occur with chronic use of all opioids, but these are not generally a concern in the treatment of acute pain. No evidence supports the use of agonist/antagonist medications (e.g., pentazocine [Talwin], butorphanol [Stadol]) to decrease opioid side effects. In fact, the literature suggests that these medications produce more side effects than more effective narcotics. One randomized, single-dose postoperative study42reported a 20 percent rate of dysphoria with pentazocine and butorphanol versus a 3 percent rate with other opioids."
