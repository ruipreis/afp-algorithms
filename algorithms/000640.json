    "abstract": "Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension. Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal. Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only after a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.",

Injury to the liver parenchyma associated with an influx of acute or chronic inflammatory cells is termed hepatitis. Cirrhosis refers to a progressive, diffuse, fibrosing, nodular condition that disrupts the entire normal architecture of the liver(Figures 2through4;Table 1).3,4Fibrosis previously was thought to be an irreversible scarring process formed in response to inflammation or direct toxic insult to the liver, but current evidence suggests that fibrosis may be reversible in some patients with chronic hepatitis B after antiretroviral therapy.8"

Although numerous pathophysiologic mechanisms of injury exist, the final common pathway is persistent wound healing resulting in hepatic parenchymal fibrosis. In most persons, approximately 80 to 90 percent of the liver parenchyma must be destroyed before liver failure is manifested clinically. When complications of cirrhosis occur, they typically are related to impaired hepatic function or actual physical disruption and reorganization of the liver parenchyma.3"

Physicians should inquire about risk factors that predispose patients to cirrhosis(Figure 1).Quantity and duration of alcohol consumption is an important factor in the early diagnosis of cirrhosis.3Other risk factors include those for hepatitis B and C transmission (e.g., birthplace in endemic areas, sexual history exposure risk, intranasal or intravenous drug use, body piercing or tattooing, accidental contamination with blood or body fluids), as well as transfusion history and personal or family history of autoimmune or hepatic diseases.3"

Decompensated disease can result in complications such as ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding from portal hypertension (discussed further in part II2). Clinical symptoms at presentation may include jaundice of the eyes or skin, pruritus, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, increasing abdominal girth, and mental status changes. Each of these clinical findings is the result of impaired hepatocellular function with or without physical obstruction secondary to cirrhosis. Because hepatic enzyme synthesis is required for drug metabolism, heightened sensitivity and medication toxicity may occur in patients with impaired hepatic enzyme synthesis.3,9"

Accurately diagnosing ascites depends upon the amount of f luid present in the abdomen, the technique used to examine the patient, and the patientâ€™s habitus. The most useful physical finding in confirming the presence of ascites is f lank dullness to percussion. When this is detected, it is helpful to determine whether it shifts with rotation of the patient (shifting dullness) or whether it can be percussed anteriorly. One study found absence of f lank dullness to be the most accurate predictor against the presence of ascites; the probability of ascites without f lank dullness was less than 10 percent.11Approximately 1,500 mL of fluid must be present before dullness is detected on physical examination, whereas routine ultrasonography can detect as little as 50 mL of f luid in the abdomen.10"

Patients with numerous large vascular spiders are at increased risk for variceal hemorrhage.13"

When a liver abnormality is suspected or identified, a liver panel, a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets, and a prothrombin time test should be performed.14Common tests in standard liver panels include the serum enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and Î³-glutamyltransferase; total, direct, and indirect serum bilirubin; and serum albumin. The ALT is thought to be the most cost-effective screening test for identifying metabolic or drug-induced hepatic injury, but like other liver function tests, it is of limited use in predicting degree of inflammation and of no use in estimating severity of fibrosis.15One study found that a platelet count of less than 160 K per mm3has a sensitivity of 80 percent for detecting cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C.16"

If these are negative, the remaining serologic work-up should include an antinuclear antibodies test or antiâ€“smooth muscle antibody test, or both, to evaluate for autoimmune hepatitis; and a fasting transferrin saturation level or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and ferritin level18to evaluate for hereditary hemochromatosis.15In patients younger than 40 years in whom Wilsonâ€™s disease is suspected, serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels should be measured,19but screening all patients with chronic hepatic injury for Wilsonâ€™s disease is not indicated.15Primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis should be suspected in patients with chronic cholestasis. Testing for Î±1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency may be of benefit in patients with chronic hepatic injury and no other apparent cause. Although the role of A1AT deficiency in liver disease in adults is not clearly defined, testing is especially important in neonates with evidence of hepatic injury.15Ultrasonography or biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of NAFLD."

Ultrasonography should be the first radiographic study performed in the evaluation of cirrhosis because it is the least expensive and does not pose a radiation exposure risk or involve intravenous contrast with the potential for nephrotoxicity as does computed tomography (CT). Nodularity, irregularity, increased echogenicity, and atrophy are ultrasonographic hallmarks of cirrhosis. In advanced disease, the gross liver appears small and multinodular, ascites may be detected, and Doppler flow can be significantly decreased in the portal circulation. The discovery of hepatic nodules via ultrasonography warrants further evaluation because benign and malignant nodules can have similar ultrasonographic appearances.20A study using high-resolution ultrasonography in patients with cirrhosis confirmed with biopsy or laparoscopy found a sensitivity and specificity for cirrhosis of 91.1 and 93.5 percent, respectively, and positive and negative predictive values of 93.2 and 91.5 percent, respectively.21"
