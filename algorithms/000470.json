    "abstract": "Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (as in Graves disease or toxic nodular goiter), administration of thyroid hormone for treatment of malignant thyroid disease, or unintentional excessive thyroid hormone therapy. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons who have suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone levels compared with those who have low but detectable levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in older adults, and with decreased bone mineral density in postmenopausal women; however, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unknown. There is lesser-quality evidence suggesting an association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and other cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and left ventricular mass, and increased bone turnover markers. Possible associations between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality of life parameters, cognition, and increased mortality rates are controversial. Prospective randomized controlled trials are needed to address the effects of early treatment on potential morbidities to help determine whether screening should be recommended in the asymptomatic general population.",

Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be divided into two categories: low but detectable TSH levels (0.1 to 0.4 mIU per L), and suppressed TSH levels (less than 0.1 mIU per L).1Although there is compelling evidence that treatment of suppressed TSH is cost-effective, particularly in older adults, the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of low but detectable TSH levels is controversial. The quality of evidence on the strength of association and benefits of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is summarized inTable 1.1"

Common causes of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, autonomous functioning thyroid adenoma, and toxic multinodular goiter. Transient TSH suppression may occur during subacute, painless, or postpartum thyroiditis. There is an inverse correlation between population iodine intake and the prevalence of thyroid autonomy (thyroid tissue that functions without TSH), with a higher prevalence in iodinedeficient areas.2The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism varies among studies because of differences in defining the TSH level for subclinical hyperthyroidism, age of the study population, and use of thyroid hormone medication. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey evaluated thyroid antibodies and TSH and free T4levels in persons older than 12 years who represented the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U.S. population.3The prevalence of TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L was 0.7 percent, whereas 3.2 percent had levels less than 0.4 mIU per L."

T4and T3levels are generally lower in persons with these conditions, whereas patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have T4and T3levels in the mid to high reference range.

The factors that seem to affect the natural history include the degree of TSH suppression and the etiology. One study prospectively evaluated 102 women older than 60 years who had subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.4 mIU per L.7Of these women, three (2.9 percent) progressed to overt hyperthyroidism; four (3.9 percent) had TSH levels decrease to less than 0.1 mIU per L, with normal T3and T4levels; 24 (23.5 percent) had normalization of TSH levels; and 71 (69.5 percent) had TSH levels remain at 0.1 to 0.4 mIU per L over a median follow-up of 41 months. This represents a 1 percent progression to overt hyperthyroidism per year. The only predictor of progression was an initial TSH level less than 0.2 mIU per L. Women older than 65 years who had subclinical hyperthyroidism and TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L had a 27 percent progression to overt hyperthyroidism over two years,8indicating that the chance of progression is higher in persons with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L."

Multinodular goiter is more common in iodinedeficient areas, and supplementation with iodine (including iodine-containing medications, such as amiodarone [Cordarone]) has been shown to precipitate subclinical hyperthyroidism.10"

A systematic review of prospective cohort studies that evaluated coronary heart disease and mortality in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH levels less than 0.3 to 0.5 mIU per L) found a modest nonsignificant increase in risk.16However, a meta-analysis involving different studies concluded that subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with a 41 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with euthyroid control patients, and that this risk increases with age.17Recently, two population cohort studies from Germany and Brazil reached conflicting results regarding the association between low TSH levels and mortality risk.18,19In an 8.5-year follow-up study in Pomerania, Germany, adjusted all-cause mortality was not increased in middle-aged patients with TSH levels less than 0.25 mIU per L.18Conversely, Brazilian patients averaging 60 years of age who had TSH levels less than 0.45 mIU per L had a significant 20.3 percent increase in all-cause mortality risk over 7.5 years, but no increase in cardiovascular disease.19"

Loss of bone mass with hyperthyroidism is a result of increased bone turnover caused by imbalance between bone reabsorption and formation,22with a resulting decrease in BMD and increase in bone turnover markers.

There are limited studies evaluating bone turnover markers in endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism; however, the findings are similar. The evidence suggests bone benefit from treating postmenopausal women with subclinical hyperthyroidism. In one study, postmenopausal women with subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH levels less than 0.2 mIU per L) due to multinodular goiter were treated with radioactive iodine ablation or were not treated, and were followed for two years.25Treated patients had normal TSH levels and no significant change in lumbar and hip BMD, whereas the untreated patients with low TSH levels had a continued loss of bone mass of about 1 to 2 percent per year. Another study found a significant increase in BMD in persons with overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism (2.8 and 1.5 percent, respectively) after six months of normalization of thyroid function tests.26"

The population-based prospective Rotterdam study evaluated a random sample of 1,846 patients older than 55 years, and found that TSH levels less than 0.4 mIU per L were associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease during a two- to four-year follow-up.29This risk was significantly higher in patients with both low TSH levels and positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, raising the possibility of an autoimmune mechanism. However, a recent study with the same population did not find an association between incident dementia or Alzheimer disease and TSH levels in a five-year follow-up.30A population-based study in Italy revealed that patients older than 65 years who had TSH levels less than 0.46 mIU per L had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores compared with euthyroid agematched control patients (22.61 Â± 6.88 versus 24.72 Â± 4.52, respectively [P< .03]).31In multivariate regression analysis, these patients had a more than twofold higher likelihood of cognitive impairment compared with agematched control patients.31Further studies are needed to clarify whether there is a causal relationship between subclinical hyperthyroidism and cognitive decline, or whether the association between low TSH levels and dementia is confounded by a higher prevalence of nonthyroidal illness in older adults."

A criterion for recommending a screening test should be that detection and treatment of a disorder in asymptomatic persons would result in measurable improvement in health outcomes compared with persons who are not screened. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded in 2004 that there is good evidence that an undetectable TSH level is a risk factor for later development of atrial fibrillation, but there are no studies addressing whether treatment would prevent this complication.32Similarly, a panel representing members of the American Thyroid Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and The Endocrine Society published the conclusions of their consensus conference evaluating the strength of the evidence for the management of subclinical thyroid disease with a recommendation against population-based screening for thyroid disease.1However, it is also emphasized that recommendations derived from evidence-based medicine are population-based, and that physicians should use their best clinical judgment in the context of the recommendations for screening in individual patients."
