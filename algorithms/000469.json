    "abstract": "Croup is a common illness responsible for up to 15 percent of emergency department visits due to respiratory disease in children in the United States. Croup symptoms usually start like an upper respiratory tract infection, with low-grade fever and coryza followed by a barking cough and various degrees of respiratory distress. In most children, the symptoms subside quickly with resolution of the cough within two days. Croup is often caused by viruses, with parainfluenza virus (types 1 to 3) as the most common. However, physicians should consider other diagnoses, including bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, foreign body aspiration, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and angioedema. Humidification therapy has not been proven beneficial. A single dose of dexamethasone (0.15 to 0.60 mg per kg usually given orally) is recommended in all patients with croup, including those with mild disease. Nebulized epinephrine is an accepted treatment in patients with moderate to severe croup. Most episodes of croup are mild, with only 1 to 8 percent of patients with croup requiring hospital admission and less than 3 percent of admitted patients requiring intubation.",

Bacterial tracheitis does not respond to usual croup treatment. Intravenous antibiotics are needed, and intubation may become necessary. Acute epiglottitis typically leads to a more toxic appearance than croup. The classic presentation of epiglottitis is an anxious child with a sore throat who is drooling and sitting or leaning forward; the characteristic barking cough of croup is typically absent.8"

Hence, physicians should consider bacterial tracheitis when treating patients with severe respiratory symptoms suggestive of croup or epiglottitis.21Other diagnoses to consider include foreign body aspiration, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and angioedema.

Abrupt onset of barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor is highly suggestive of croup.17Physical examination typically reveals low-grade fever and the absence of wheezing. Diagnosis also involves closely assessing the severity of croup by evaluating respiratory status and rate, retractions, stridor, heart rate, use of accessory muscles, and mental status.17Although severity assessment scores occasionally have been used clinically, they are primarily for research purposes.9Validation studies in the emergency department setting have shown a wide range of interobserver reliability among physicians using the assessment scores.22The most reliable findings to assess severity are the presence of stridor and the severity of retractions.22Pulse oximetry can also be used to assess the severity of disease."

Oxygen should be administered when the child is hypoxic or in severe respiratory distress. Heliox, a helium-oxygen mixture, has been used to reduce airflow resistance and turbulence. Although case reports have been encouraging, a systematic review found insufficient evidence that heliox is beneficial for croup.35Likewise, studies do not support the routine use of exposure to cold air, antipyretics, analgesics, antitussives, decongestants, or prophylactic antibiotics."

Heated humidification should not be used because of the risk of scalding the child.
