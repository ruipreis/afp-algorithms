    "abstract": "Constipation is a common complaint in older adults. Although constipation is not a physiologic consequence of normal aging, decreased mobility and other comorbid medical conditions may contribute to its increased prevalence in older adults. Functional constipation is diagnosed when no secondary causes can be identified, such as a medical condition or a medicine with a side effect profile that includes constipation. Empiric treatment may be tried initially for patients with functional constipation. Management of chronic constipation includes keeping a stool diary to record the nature of the bowel movements, counseling on bowel training, increasing fluid and dietary fiber intake, and increasing physical activity. There are a variety of over-the-counter and prescription laxatives available for the treatment of constipation. Fiber and laxatives increase stool frequency and improve symptoms of constipation. If constipation is refractory to medical treatment, further diagnostic evaluation may be warranted to assess for colonic transit time and anorectal dysfunction. Alternative treatment methods such as biofeedback and surgery may be considered for these patients.",

Normal transit constipation, also known as functional constipation, is the most common. In patients with functional constipation, stool passes through the colon at a normal rate. Slow transit constipation is characterized by prolonged delay in the passage of stool through the colon.7Patients may complain of abdominal bloating and infrequent bowel movements.8The causes for slow transit constipation are unclear; the postulated mechanisms include abnormalities of the myenteric plexus, defective cholinergic innervation, and anomalies of the noradrenergic neuro-muscular transmission system.7Anorectal dysfunction is the inefficient coordination of the pelvic musculature in the evacuation mechanism.9These patients are more likely to complain of a feeling of incomplete evacuation, a sense of obstruction, or a need for digital manipulation.8Anorectal dysfunction may be an acquired behavioral disorder, or the process of defecation may not have been learned in childhood.10"

Although opioid therapy almost always causes some degree of constipation, individual opioids induce constipation to different degrees. One study16found that fentanyl (Duragesic) was less likely to cause constipation than oral morphine. In most cases, a prophylactic laxative should be considered when prescribing chronic opioid therapy because tolerance to the constipating effects of opioids does not develop over time."

A dietary diary may be helpful to assess whether an adequate amount of fiber is consumed daily. Most healthy Americans consume 5 to 10 g of fiber daily.12The daily recommended fiber intake is 20 to 35 g daily.12If fiber intake is substantially less than this, patients should be encouraged to increase their intake of fiber-rich foods such as bran, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Prune juice is commonly used to relieve constipation. The recommendation is to increase fiber by 5 g per day each week until reaching the daily recommended intake.12Adding fiber to the diet too quickly may cause excessive gas and bloating."

However, they have been associated with electrolyte imbalance within the colonic lumen and may precipitate hypokalemia, fluid and salt overload, and diarrhea. Therefore, they should be used carefully in patients with congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency.
