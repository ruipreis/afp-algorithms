First, in the middle column, the text should have read as follows: “Viral load low but still detectable (more than a 100-fold drop):patient has reasonable odds of responding; continue treatment another 12 weeks and retest viral load. When viral load becomes undetectable, continue treatment for another 36 weeks.” Second, an arrow should have pointed from this box of text to “At 24 weeks after completion of treatment, recheck for presence of viral RNA.” Third, the right-hand column should have read: “Viral load undetectable: patient has an improved chance of sustained viral response; finish complete course of treatment.” The online version of this article has been corrected and the corrected figure is reprinted below."
