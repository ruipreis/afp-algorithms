    "abstract": "Neck pain is a common presenting symptom in the primary care setting and causes significant disability. The broad differential diagnosis requires an efficient but global assessment; therefore, emphasis is typically placed on red flags that can assist in the early recognition and treatment of more concerning diagnoses, such as traumatic injuries, infection, malignancy, vascular emergencies, and other inflammatory conditions. The critical element in appropriate diagnosis and management of these conditions is an accurate patient history. Physical examination findings complement and refine diagnostic cues from the history but often lack the specificity to be of value independently. Diagnostic tools such as imaging and electrodiagnostic tests have variable utility, especially in chronic or degenerative conditions. Treatment of mechanical or nonneuropathic neck pain includes short-term use of medications and possibly injections. However, long-term data for these interventions are limited. Acupuncture and other complementary and alternative therapies may be helpful in some cases. Advanced imaging and surgical evaluation may be warranted for patients with worsening neurologic function or persistent pain.",

Family physicians must be able to recognize when neck pain signals a potentially serious condition and should be able to generate an accurate diagnosis through findings from the patient's history, physical examination, and appropriate testing."

Injury to the central spinal cord or nerve roots may be the result of degenerative changes, trauma, mass effect, infection, or other inflammatory or demyelinating conditions.Even without an acute presentation, physicians should be mindful of myelopathic signs and symptoms.4Myelopathy refers to neurologic compromise resulting from a disturbance of spinal cord tracts within the spinal canal. Initial symptoms include deep, aching neck pain with possible radicular symptoms and muscle weakness; these can quickly progress to gait changes, ataxia, and bowel and bladder dysfunction.5Physical examination findings associated with a myelopathic disease process include increased muscle tone, fasciculation, clonus, hyperreflexia, the Babinski reflex, and the Lhermitte and Hoffmann signs."

These symptoms in a patient with neck stiffness, photophobia, or other focal neuropathic findings should raise concern for meningitis, epidural abscess, or diskitis (i.e., a bacterial infection of the intervertebral disk tissue). Similarly, neck pain in the setting of described or observed weight loss, significant lymphadenopathy, unexplained fever, or fatigue may signal malignancy or an underlying inflammatory condition."

Cervical spine pathology is present in more than one-half of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the long-term risk of severe pathology in these patients is higher than in unaffected people.6Individuals with trisomy 21 are at risk of atlanto-occipital instability, which should prompt concern for complications of even mild trauma, as well as for advanced or premature degenerative changes.7Ankylosing spondylitis can cause neck stiffness and pain. Patients with this condition also have an increased risk of complications from mild trauma.8Numerous other processes and conditions can be considered in the differential of neck pain, including herpes zoster, angina, endocrine and compressive tumors, fibromyalgia, and psychogenic pain. Many of these conditions can overlap and be part of multifactorial presentations. One study estimated that 43% of neck pain cases are nonneuropathic, 7% are neuropathic, and 50% are mixed.9"

Although practice patterns may prompt the use of specific agents, there is little evidence to support the long-term use of these medications in most patients with neck pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral muscle relaxants are commonly recommended for patients with nonneuropathic pain. Data on the effectiveness of these medications for neck pain are limited; however, these agents are not effective for similar musculoskeletal conditions, such as low back pain.23Although there is some evidence that oral corticosteroids provide short-term pain relief in patients with acute radiculopathy,24there is little evidence that any medication affects recovery. Tramadol may have some benefit, but only in the short term.25Narcotics can provide modest short-term pain relief, but there is no evidence of sustained benefit, and the risks of cognitive impairment and abuse limit their use.26Inflammatory conditions may briefly respond to steroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but there is minimal evidence that these medications provide lasting benefit in degenerative conditions, despite their widespread use.4Similarly, injections of anesthetics, corticosteroids, or botulinum toxin have shown little or no long-term benefit in acute or chronic neck pain.27,28There is limited evidence for the short-term use (one to two months) of radiofrequency ablation in patients with persistent cervical pain.29"
