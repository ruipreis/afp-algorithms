    "abstract": "Nephrolithiasis is a common condition affecting nearly 5 percent of U.S. men and women during their lifetimes. Recurrent calculi can be prevented in most patients by the use of a simplified evaluation, reasonable dietary and fluid recommendations, and directed pharmacologic intervention. Serum studies and 24-hour urine collections are the mainstays of metabolic investigation and usually are warranted in patients with recurrent calculi. Although some stones are the result of inherited conditions, most result from a complex interaction between diet, fluid habits, and genetic predisposition. Calcium-sparing diuretics such as thiazides often are used to treat hypercalciuria. Citrate medications increase levels of this naturally occurring stone inhibitor. Allopurinol can be helpful in patients with hyperuricosuria, and urease inhibitors can help break the cycle of infectious calculi. Aggressive fluid intake and moderated intake of salt, calcium, and meat are recommended for most patients.",

At this point, the pain of acute renal colic is severe and can be debilitating. Patients commonly describe the pain as crampy and intermittent. It usually originates in the flank and radiates toward the groin. Because calculus movement is associated with obstruction of a hollow viscus, many patients suffer from associated nausea, with or without emesis. Most patients have at least microscopic amounts of blood in the urine, and gross hematuria is possible. Patients with obstructing struvite calculi (i.e., stones associated with urinary infection) may present with fevers, chills, and flank pain.

The rates of passage decrease as stone size increases; a 1-cm stone has a less than 10 percent chance of passing without surgical intervention.7Recent studies8have suggested that the use of the alpha1-adrenergic blocker tamsulosin (Flomax) can increase the chance of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones. However, immediate surgical intervention with a ureteral stent or percutaneous nephrostomy is necessary if the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of obstruction and sepsis. Clinically stable patients usually are given the option of attempting to pass the stone spontaneously if it is not too large and if the pain is manageable with oral narcotics. Surgical options include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopic stone extraction, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy."

Avoidance of large quantities of highâ€“oxalate-containing foods is recommended.

Hypercalciuria (i.e., more than 250 mg per 24 hours [6.2 mmol per day]) is the most common metabolic abnormality associated with these calculi, followed by hypocitraturia (i.e., less than 450 mg per 24 hours [2.34 mmol per day]), which involves a deficiency of the naturally occurring stone inhibitor citrate. The cause of hypocitraturia often is idiopathic, although high dietary acid loads (e.g., from excessive meat intake) and dehydration can exacerbate this condition. Other causes of calcium oxalate stones include hyperoxaluria (i.e., more than 45 mg per 24 hours [500 Î¼mol per day]) and hyperuricosuria (i.e., more than 800 mg per 24 hours [4.76 mmol per day]). Treatments for these stones depend on the underlying condition(Table 4). Note that there are no specific medications for hyperoxaluria; medical treatment consists of increasing calcium intake (particularly with meals) to control enteric hyperoxaluria. Additionally, decreasing the intake of oxalates contained in foods such as spinach, rhubarb, beets, chocolate, nuts, tea, strawberries, soy foods, and wheat bran may be beneficial.17Calcium oxalate calculi not associated with an obvious laboratory abnormality can be treated empirically with oral potassium citrate (Urocit-K, 30 to 60 mEq per day) or sodium citrate (Bicitra) to increase urine pH and levels of urinary citrate.18,19"

They often are associated with acidification disorders such as renal tubular acidosis20; less common etiologies include primary hyperparathyroidism, excessive alkalinization, and sarcoidosis. Renal tubular acidosis is associated with hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia. Medical treatment of these stones consists of replenishing urinary citrate to prevent new stone formation and delay growth of existing stones. Care must be taken to avoid excessive alkalinization, because high urinary pH can increase the urinary supersaturation of calcium phosphate salts. If hypercalciuria persists, addition of a thiazide diuretic is indicated.21"

            "text": "Uric acid stones may consist of uric acid only, or they also may contain calcium.22Uric acid is a by-product of ingested or endogenous purine metabolism and is excreted in the urine primarily in insoluble form. The primary cause of uric acid stones is a urinary pH below the pKafor uric acid (5.5). Other predisposing conditions include gout, insulin-resistant states, and end-ileostomies. Men with gout have a twofold risk of having a uric acid calculus.23In general, these patients excrete excessive uric acid (although some have normouricosuria) and have low urinary pH and urine volumes. Excess ingestion of animal meat protein (i.e., meat of all types, including poultry) can be detected by measuring urinary sulfate levels. Radiographic imaging can be difficult because pure uric acid calculi typically are radiolucent. They are, however, readily apparent on noncontrast CT. In addition to the general measures outlined above, treatment of uric acid stones involves correction of urinary pH. Potassium citrate at a dosage of 30 to 60 mEq per day will raise the urinary pH to greater than 5.5 (6.5 to 7 is ideal).24Allopurinol (Zyloprim) at a dosage of 300 mg daily can be added in patients with hyperuricemia."

Recurrent urinary tract infections with urea-splitting organisms (e.g.,Proteus mirabilis, Urea-plasma urealyticum, Klebsiella pneumoniae) result in alkalinization of urine and the addition of ammonium to the milieu.25Struvite stones are usually radiopaque on standard radiographic imaging but may be quite faint.

After surgical intervention, medical therapy should focus on preventing recurrent urinary tract infections. Retained residual fragments increase the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection and future calculi. Acetohydroxamic acid (Lithostat) is an irreversible inhibitor of urease and can prevent the crystallization of struvite stones.28However, because of side effects (including deep venous thrombosis), it generally is reserved for use in patients who cannot tolerate surgical intervention.29"
