    "abstract": "Acne is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is the most common skin disorder in the United States. Therapy targets the four factors responsible for lesion formation: increased sebum production, hyperkeratinization, colonization byPropionibacterium acnes, and the resultant inflammatory reaction. Treatment goals include scar prevention, reduction of psychological morbidity, and resolution of lesions. Grading acne based on lesion type and severity can help guide treatment. Topical retinoids are effective in treating inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions by preventing comedones, reducing existing comedones, and targeting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide is an over-the-counter bactericidal agent that does not lead to bacterial resistance. Topical and oral antibiotics are effective as monotherapy, but are more effective when combined with topical retinoids. The addition of benzoyl peroxide to antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of bacterial resistance. Oral isotretinoin is approved for the treatment of severe recalcitrant acne and can be safely administered using the iPLEDGE program. After treatment goals are reached, maintenance therapy should be initiated. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of laser and light therapies. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered if treatment goals are not met.",

It is typified by the eruption of a comedo within the follicle, which is preceded by a microcomedo.1Four main factors lead to the formation of acne lesions: (1) increased sebum production by sebaceous glands, in which androgens have an important role; (2) hyperkeratinization of the follicle, leading to a microcomedo that eventually enlarges into a comedo; (3) colonization of the follicle by the anaerobePropionibacterium acnes; and (4) an inflammatory reaction.2The inflammatory events may begin before hyperkeratinization of the follicle.3Current therapies target these four factors for acute control of flare-ups and long-term maintenance."

The spectrum of acne lesions ranges from noninflammatory open or closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads;Figure 1) to inflammatory lesions, which may be papules, pustules, or nodules (Figures 2through4). Lesions are most likely to occur on the face, neck, chest, and back, where there is a higher concentration of sebaceous glands. Other conditions can mimic acne, and even include the term acne in their nomenclature, but they lack the presence of comedones.Table 1outlines the differential diagnosis for acne.4Grading acne based on the type of lesions and their severity can help in deciding which therapies are warranted(Figure 5); however, there is no consensus on the best grading system.5"

Topical retinoids also possess anti-inflammatory properties, making them somewhat useful in the treatment of inflammatory lesions.6Topical retinoids are indicated as monotherapy for noninflammatory acne and as combination therapy with antibiotics to treat inflammatory acne. Additionally, they are useful for maintenance after treatment goals have been reached and systemic drugs are discontinued.2Overall, adapalene (Differin) is the best tolerated topical retinoid. Limited evidence suggests that tazarotene (Tazorac) is more effective than adapalene and tretinoin (Retin-A). There is no evidence that any formulation is superior to another.6"
