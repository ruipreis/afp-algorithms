Instead of focusing on how treatment affects markers of glycemic control, which has not shown benefit, treatments should be based on anticipated reductions in cardiovascular and kidney disease outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists demonstrate consistent risk reductions for mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and renal outcomes, irrespective of their effects on glycemia. The BMJ/MAGIC Group performed a systematic review to determine which patients may benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists."
