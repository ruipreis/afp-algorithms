    "abstract": "Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by a low or undetectable serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, with normal free thyroxine and total or free triiodothyronine levels. It can be caused by increased endogenous production of thyroid hormone (e.g., in Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter, or transient thyroiditis), by administration of thyroid hormone to treat malignant thyroid disease, or by unintentional excessive replacement therapy. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism in the general population is about 1% to 2%; however, it may be higher in iodine-deficient areas. The rate of progression to overt hyperthyroidism is higher in persons with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L than in persons with low but detectable thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and heart failure in older adults, increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and decreased bone mineral density and increased bone fracture risk in postmenopausal women. However, the effectiveness of treatment in preventing these conditions is unclear. A possible association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and quality-of-life parameters and cognition is controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons. The American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend treating patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels less than 0.1 mIU per L if they are older than 65 years or have comorbidities such as heart disease or osteoporosis.",

Since the most recent review on this topic,2studies have strengthened the association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and the risk of cardiovascular disease and bone fractures(Table 1).1â€“7Emerging evidence shows the benefits of treating subclinical hyperthyroidism in patients with TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L, particularly in older adults and patients at high risk of cardiovascular events and bone loss."

Common causes of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism include Graves disease, autonomous functioning thyroid adenoma, and multinodular toxic goiter. Transient TSH suppression may occur during subacute, painless (silent), or postpartum thyroiditis.8Iodine-deficient areas have a higher prevalence of thyroid autonomy. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey evaluated TSH, free T4, and thyroid antibody levels in a sample population older than 12 years that represented the geographic and ethnic distribution of the U.S. population.9The prevalence of TSH levels less than 0.1 mIU per L was 0.7%, whereas 1.8% had levels less than 0.4 mIU per L. The prevalence of endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism can be as high as 15% in patients older than 70 years who live in iodine-deficient regions.10Subclinical hyperthyroidism is most common in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy; the prevalence in these patients may be as high as 20%,11particularly in those taking desiccated thyroid hormone."

In general, free T4and T3levels tend to be lower in persons with these conditions, whereas persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have free T4and T3levels in the mid to high reference range. Reassessment of TSH, free T3, and free T4levels is appropriate after two to four months to evaluate whether low TSH is persistent and whether subclinical thyroid disease has progressed to overt hyperthyroidism. A suggested diagnostic approach is outlined inFigure 1.2"
