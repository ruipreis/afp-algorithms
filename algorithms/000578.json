    "abstract": "Foot infections are common in patients with diabetes and are associated with high morbidity and risk of lower extremity amputation. Diabetic foot infections are classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Gram-positive bacteria, such asStaphylococcus aureusand beta-hemolytic streptococci, are the most common pathogens in previously untreated mild and moderate infection. Severe, chronic, or previously treated infections are often polymicrobial. The diagnosis of diabetic foot infection is based on the clinical signs and symptoms of local inflammation. Infected wounds should be cultured after debridement. Tissue specimens obtained by scraping the base of the ulcer with a scalpel or by wound or bone biopsy are strongly preferred to wound swabs. Imaging studies are indicated for suspected deep soft tissue purulent collections or osteomyelitis. Optimal management requires aggressive surgical debridement and wound management, effective antibiotic therapy, and correction of metabolic abnormalities (mainly hyperglycemia and arterial insufficiency). Treatment with antibiotics is not required for noninfected ulcers. Mild soft tissue infection can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics, including dicloxacillin, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Severe soft tissue infection can be initially treated intravenously with ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin; piperacillin/tazobactam; or imipenem/cilastatin. The risk of methicillin-resistantS. aureusinfection should be considered when choosing a regimen. Antibiotic treatment should last from one to four weeks for soft tissue infection and six to 12 weeks for osteomyelitis and should be followed by culture-guided definitive therapy.",

Patients with diabetes lose the protective sensations for temperature and pain, impairing awareness of trauma such as abrasions, blistering, or penetrating foreign body. Motor neuropathy can result in foot deformities (e.g., claw toe) that contribute to local pressure from footwear, making skin ulceration even more likely. Once the skin is broken (typically on the plantar surface), the underlying tissues are exposed to colonization by pathogenic organisms. The resulting wound infection may begin superficially, but with delay in treatment and impaired body defense mechanisms caused by neutrophil dysfunction and vascular insufficiency, it can spread to the contiguous subcutaneous tissues and to even deeper structures.3,4"

The clinical diagnosis of foot infection is based on the presence of purulent discharge from an ulcer or the classic signs of inflammation (i.e., erythema, pain, tenderness, warmth, or induration). Other suggestive features of infection include foul odor, the presence of necrosis, and failure of wound healing despite optimal management.10Local inflammatory findings may be less prominent or absent in some diabetic foot infections. For example, pain and tenderness may be reduced or absent in patients who have neuropathy, whereas erythema may be absent in those with vascular disease.11Acute Charcot's foot is characterized by a progressive deterioration of weight-bearing joints, usually in the foot or ankle. It can clinically mimic cellulitis and presents as erythema, edema, and elevated temperature of the foot. Most patients with diabetic foot infection do not have systemic features such as fever or chills. The presence of systemic signs or symptoms indicates a severe deep infection.12"

Calculation of ABI is done by measuring the resting systolic blood pressure in the ankle and arm using a Doppler probe. An ABI of 0.91 to 1.30 is borderline or normal. An ABI of 0.41 to 0.90 indicates mild to moderate PAD and an ABI of 0.40 or less indicates advanced ischemia. An ABI greater than 1.30 suggests the presence of calcified vessels and the need for additional vascular studies, such as pulse volume recording or measurement of the toe-brachial index. Patients with atypical symptoms, or whose diagnosis is in doubt, should have ABI measured after exercise on a treadmill. An ABI that decreases by 20 percent following exercise is diagnostic of PAD, whereas a normal ABI following exercise rules out PAD. If a PAD diagnosis is confirmed and revascularization is planned, magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, or contrast angiography can be performed for anatomic evaluation.20"

Combining technetium bone scan with gallium scan or white blood cell scan may improve the diagnostic yield for osteomyelitis.21,22Magnetic resonance imaging provides more accurate information regarding the extent of the infectious process.23Ultrasonography and computed tomography are also helpful in evaluating abnormalities in the soft tissue (e.g., abscess, sinus tract, cortical bone involvement) and may provide guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic aspiration, drainage, or tissue biopsy.21"
