    "abstract": "In the United States, pneumonia is the most common cause of hospitalization in children. Even in hospitalized children, community-acquired pneumonia is most likely of viral etiology, with respiratory syncytial virus being the most common pathogen, especially in children younger than two years. Typical presenting signs and symptoms include tachypnea, cough, fever, and anorexia. Findings most strongly associated with an infiltrate on chest radiography in children with clinically suspected pneumonia are grunting, history of fever, retractions, crackles, tachypnea, and the overall clinical impression. Chest radiography should be ordered if the diagnosis is uncertain, if patients have hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress, or if patients fail to show clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy. Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia is appropriate in patients without respiratory distress who can tolerate oral antibiotics. Amoxicillin is the first-line antibiotic with coverage forStreptococcus pneumoniaefor school-aged children, and treatment should not exceed seven days. Patients requiring hospitalization and empiric parenteral therapy should be transitioned to oral antibiotics once they are clinically improving and able to tolerate oral intake. Childhood and maternal immunizations againstS. pneumoniae,Haemophilus influenzaetype b,Bordetella pertussis, and influenza virus are the key to prevention.",
