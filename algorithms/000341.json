    "abstract": "Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures have a favorable risk-benefit profile and are increasingly important as part of the overall management of obesity. These procedures are effective at inducing weight loss and improving comorbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and sleep apnea. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has several typical complications, and family physicians should recognize these as part of a team-based approach to the management of obesity. Gastric band slippage, port or tubing malfunction, stomal obstruction, band erosion, pouch dilation, and port infection are examples of complications that may occur after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Upper gastrointestinal tract imaging is often required to diagnose these complications. Some complications can be managed in the primary care setting through behavioral diet modification or removal of fluid from the band (band deflation); however, other complications require surgical repair or removal of the band.",

            "text": "Surgery for morbid obesity has become an integral part of managing this common and serious chronic illness, and it is the only therapy proven to induce sustained weight loss. Previously considered an option of last resort, surgical management of obesity now has a more favorable risk-benefit profile and is appropriate earlier in the course of management. Although there are risks with bariatric surgery, these procedures have been shown to have low rates of surgical mortality comparable to those of other commonly performed procedures.1Current bariatric procedures result not only in substantial weight loss but also in improvements for many associated comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and sleep apnea.2The number of bariatric procedures performed has increased dramatically over the previous decade, although it has plateaued to approximately 113,000 cases per year in the United States.3Approximately 1% of eligible patients with morbid obesity undergo bariatric surgery.4"

Early postoperative complications, including infection, stomal stenosis, or hernia, are often addressed at surgical follow-up, but may be identified in the primary care setting. Short-term perioperative death is most often caused by pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction. Family physicians may help coordinate postoperative care or implement steps to prevent complications.10Some postoperative problems are related to poor adherence to a dietary plan, and patients may need reeducation of appropriate postoperative eating habits, including eating small portions and avoiding liquids while eating.11"

Many of these can be associated with failure to lose weight. After band system assessment and dietary evaluation, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) radiographic study with contrast media is typically indicated to assess for band positioning or gastric prolapse. Focal abdominal tenderness, particularly with vague abdominal pain, weight regain, or evidence of superficial infection at the port site, requires endoscopy to evaluate for gastric erosion. Assessing the port system integrity and performing upper GI imaging are the best initial steps to evaluate abdominal pain, vomiting, or dysphagia after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.7,11â€“13"
