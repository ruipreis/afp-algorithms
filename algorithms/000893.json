    "abstract": "Decreased libido disproportionately affects patients with depression. The relationship between depression and decreased libido may be blurred, but treating one condition frequently improves the other. Medications used to treat depression may decrease libido and sexual function. Frequently, patients do not volunteer problems related to sexuality, and physicians rarely ask about such problems. Asking a depressed patient about libido and sexual function and tailoring treatment to minimize adverse effects on sexual function can significantly increase treatment compliance and improve the quality of the patient's life.",

In a national survey conducted in 1994, 33 percent of women and 17 percent of men reported sexual disinterest.1In another survey, one third of women 18 to 59 years of age reported feeling a lack of sexual desire within the previous year.2Patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder have an even higher prevalence of sexual dysfunction, including lowered libido, than the general population.3"

The complex association between depression and lowered libido is further illustrated in a case control study in which increased lifetime prevalence rates of affective disorder were found among patients with inhibited sexual desire.5"

Patients under-report sexual problems caused by medications.6,7They may acknowledge a decline in libido only if their partner complains. Even when a declining interest in sex is recognized, it may be rationalized on the basis of social values and practices, especially among aging women.8Discovery of sexual problems is further limited by the frequent failure of physicians to ask about such problems.9The latter point is critical: in one study it was found that patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were four times more likely to reveal sexual dysfunction if asked directly by their physician.7"

When tricyclics are prescribed for pain, it is not uncommon for them to be used in conjunction with SSRIs. SSRIs increase serum levels of tricyclics, so this combination may affect libido more than either alone.Table 1summarizes the effects of various antidepressants and antipsychotics on libido."

Evidence supports several treatment options in patients who experience sexual dysfunction or decreased libido as a consequence of anti-depressant use. These include decreasing the dosage of an SSRI or tricyclic antidepressant, instigating medication holidays, adding or switching to bupropion, and using nefazodone as an alternative agent. Cause and effect may not be clear, but addressing sexual desire when treating depression may improve compliance and overall outcome."
