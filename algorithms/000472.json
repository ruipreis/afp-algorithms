In the third row of the algorithm, the low ferritin level should have led to “Iron deficiency anemia” and the “Ferritin level normal to high” should have led to “Check serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation.” The online version of this figure has been corrected and the figure is reprinted here."
