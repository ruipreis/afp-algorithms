Inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers have HBV infection of the liver without significant, ongoing necroinflammatory disease. HBV infection is resolved when there is no further virologic, biochemical, or histologic evidence of active viral infection or disease. Acute exacerbations or flares include intermittent elevations of transaminase activity to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal and more than twice the baseline value. Reactivation is characterized by the reappearance of active necroinflammatory disease of the liver in persons with inactive HBsAg or resolved hepatitis B. HBeAg clearance is the loss of HBeAg in persons who were previously HBeAg positive. HBeAg seroconversion is defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBeAg in persons who were previously HBeAg positive and anti-HBeAg negative, whereas reversion is the reappearance of HBeAg in persons who were previously HBeAg negative and anti-HBeAg positive."
