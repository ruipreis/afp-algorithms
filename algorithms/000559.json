    "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the most common sleep-related patient symptoms, and it affects an estimated 20 percent of the population. Persons with excessive daytime sleepiness are at risk of motor vehicle and work-related incidents, and have poorer health than comparable adults. The most common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness are sleep deprivation, obstructive sleep apnea, and sedating medications. Other potential causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include certain medical and psychiatric conditions and sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy. Obstructive sleep apnea is a particularly significant cause of excessive daytime sleepiness. An estimated 26 to 32 percent of adults are at risk of or have obstructive sleep apnea, and the prevalence is expected to increase. The evaluation and management of excessive daytime sleepiness is based on the identification and treatment of underlying conditions (particularly obstructive sleep apnea), and the appropriate use of activating medications.",

Studies that restricted healthy adults to six hours of sleep per night for 14 successive nights showed a cumulative significant impairment of neurobiological functions.12Symptoms of sleep deprivation can occur after only one night of sleep loss,12and persons who are chronically sleep deprived are often unaware of their increasing cognitive and performance deficits.8Paradoxically, most types of chronic insomnia (including primary insomnia, psychopathological insomnia, and paradoxical insomnia) are associated with daytime hyperarousal rather than excessive daytime sleepiness. The presence of excessive daytime sleepiness in a patient with insomnia suggests a comorbidity such as a sleep-related breathing disorder or a mood disorder.13"

Sedating antihistamines, longer-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants are associated with decreased performance on driving tests and increased rates of next-day motor vehicle incidents attributed to daytime sleepiness.13,15,16Of the antihypertensive medications in widespread use, tiredness, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness are side effects commonly associated with beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal), but sedation is also the most common side effect reported for the alpha2-agonists clonidine (Catapres) and methyldopa (Aldomet, brand no longer available in the United States). Sedation is also commonly reported by patients taking anticonvulsant or antipsychotic medications. Among drugs of abuse, marijuana has significant sedating effects.

A sleep disorder caused by blockage of the upper airway, OSA results in episodes of cessation of breathing (apneas) or a reduction in airflow (hypopneas), and is defined as greater than or equal to five apneic or hypopneic episodes per hour of sleep. These events induce recurrent hypoxia and repetitive arousals from sleep. For adults 30 to 60 years of age, the prevalence of OSA has been estimated to be 9 percent for women and 24 percent for men. In patients with OSA, approximately 23 percent of women and 16 percent of men experience excessive daytime sleepiness.17Sleep-related breathing disorders may be significantly under-recognized as causes of excessive daytime sleepiness. One study estimated that 93 percent of women and 82 percent of men with moderate to severe OSA are undiagnosed.18Furthermore, 26 to 32 percent of U.S. adults are at risk of developing or currently have OSA. Because increasing age and obesity are significant risk factors for OSA, the prevalence of OSA is set to increase rapidly.19"

In most cases, overnight polysomnography is required to confirm the diagnosis of OSA and to determine the appropriate pressure levels for treatment using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or a similar system.25Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have developed protocols that can be utilized by certified sleep physicians for diagnosing OSA with respiratory screening instruments in patients with a high probability of OSA (Table 3).26If OSA is not confirmed by polysomnography in a patient who has significant excessive daytime sleepiness, or if sleepiness persists in a patient with OSA despite appropriate therapy, further investigation is required to quantify the level of daytime sleepiness and evaluate for the potential diagnosis of narcolepsy (Figure 2)."

Both of these tests use modified polysomnography to assess sleep onset latency (i.e., the amount of time it takes to fall asleep) during a series of waking nap periods. Overnight polysomnography is required before the MSLT or MWT to assess the disordered sleep pattern and test for significant OSA. To diagnose narcolepsy without cataplexy, the MSLT must demonstrate hypersomnolence and early onset of rapid eye movement sleep. The MWT can be used to assess improvements in waking performance after treatment in persons with excessive daytime sleepiness who could potentially be dangerous to self and others, such as commercial drivers and airplane pilots.29"

Other medications that must be used with caution to induce alertness in somnolent patients include the amphetamines (dextroamphetamine [Dexedrine], methylphenidate [Ritalin]) and pemoline (Cylert, not available in the United States).
