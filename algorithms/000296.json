The article “Diagnosis and Management of Sodium Disorders: Hyponatremia and Hypernatremia” (March 1, 2015, p.299) contained errors inFigure 1(p. 301) andFigure 2(p. 304). InFigure 1, the urinary sodium values for hypervolemic hyponatremia were transposed. The algorithm should have showed that urinary sodium < 20 mEq per L may indicate heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrosis, and hypoalbuminemia, whereas urinary sodium > 20 mEq per L may indicate renal failure.Figure 2should have indicated that desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every four to six hours should be considered only after the infusion of 3% saline (1 to 2 mL per kg per hour). The corrected figures are printed above and on p. 432, and the online version of the article has been corrected."
