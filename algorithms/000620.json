The degree of vascular involvement is usually minor, the rate of progression is slow, and the appropriate therapeutic approach is preventive, with an emphasis on healthy lifestyle choices and behavior modification. However, significantly accelerated atherosclerosis occurs in some childhood disease states, with clinical coronary events occurring in childhood and early adulthood. Data from studies examining the future risk of cardiovascular disease in children are limited; no randomized trials have documented the effects of risk reduction on clinical outcomes. However, a growing body of literature points to the significance of premature cardiovascular disease in certain childhood diagnoses and emphasizes the importance of risk reduction by disease stratification(Table 1)."

They often present with elevated LDL levels noted on blood screening or after investigation prompted by a family history of premature cardiovascular disease or hyperlipidemia.

Lipid-lowering therapy should be considered in children with elevated LDL levels, but other factors such as sex, a family history of premature disease, additional risk factors, and the wishes of the family should be taken into account. If the decision is made to begin drug treatment, initial therapy with a statin is recommended in boys 10 years and older and in girls after the onset of menses. Statins may be initiated at a younger age in selected patients with extremely high LDL levels, associated lipid abnormalities or other risk factors, or a particularly worrisome family history. Bile acidâ€“binding resins and cholesterol absorption inhibitors should be considered as adjunctive therapy."

Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are implicated in endothelial dysfunction, to a greater degree in type 2 diabetes than in type 1. Patients with type 2 diabetes often have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The factors that predispose some persons to progress to type 2 diabetes are not well understood. Parental history is important in risk assessment, and in the future, genetic markers may help identify children of diabetic parents who are at greatest risk of diabetes.

By contrast, type 2 diabetes diagnosed in childhood usually presents asymptomatically, with mild to moderate hyperglycemia in adolescence in combination with obesity, signs of insulin resistance, and other components of the metabolic syndrome. When type 2 diabetes begins in childhood, the risk of accelerated atherosclerosis is increased beyond that seen in those who develop type 2 diabetes as adults. Based on the recommendations given inFigure 1, patients with type 2 diabetes will almost always be managed as high risk because of associated comorbidities. Aggressive management of related risk factors improves outcomes and is recommended."
