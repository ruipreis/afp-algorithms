Because there is considerable overlap in the definitions of dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (i.e., frequent heartburn or acid regurgitation), the AGA recommends further research to better define dyspepsia."

If no obvious GERD or NSAID use is present, the AGArecommends that patients 55 years or younger without alarm symptoms be tested forHelicobacter pyloriinfection.
