    "abstract": "Low-molecular-weight heparin is a relatively recent addition to the list of therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). As a prophylactic, low-molecular-weight heparin is as effective as standard heparin or warfarin and does not require monitoring of the activated partial thromboplastin time or the International Normalized Ratio. Traditionally, treatment for DVT required patients to be hospitalized for administration of intravenous heparin. With subcutaneous injections of low-molecular-weight heparin, treatment of DVT can be initiated or completed in the outpatient setting with no increased risk of recurrent thromboembolism or bleeding complications. Low-molecular-weight heparin is an attractive option for use in patients with a first episode of DVT, no risk factors for bleeding and the ability to administer injections with or without the help of a visiting nurse or family member.",

Epidemiologic data suggest that the annual incidence of a first episode of DVT ranges from 60 to 180 cases per 100,000 people, or more than 300,000 new cases annually in the United States.1The cost burden of this disease is quite high, since most patients with DVT require one or more diagnostic tests, treatment with intravenous heparin and a three- to seven-day hospital stay.2Low-molecular-weight heparin, which is administered by subcutaneous injection, offers the option of treatment on an outpatient basis for patients with DVT. Low-molecular-weight heparin can also be used effectively in patients requiring prophylaxis for DVT after general or orthopedic surgery."

Low-molecular-weight heparin is administered according to body weight once or twice daily, both during the high-risk period when prophylaxis for DVT is recommended and also when waiting for oral anticoagulation to take effect in the treatment of DVT. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) does not need to be monitored, and the dosage does not need to be adjusted. Since low-molecular-weight heparin is given subcutaneously, outpatient administration by the patient, with or without the assistance of a visiting nurse or family member, is both possible and cost-effective."

Whereas standard heparin has a molecular weight of 5,000 to 30,000 daltons, low-molecular-weight heparin ranges from 1,000 to 10,000 daltons, resulting in properties that are distinct from those of traditional heparin. Low-molecular-weight heparin binds less strongly to protein, has enhanced bioavailability, interacts less with platelets and yields a very predictable dose response, eliminating the need to monitor the aPPT. Low-molecular-weight heparin, like standard heparin, binds to antithrombin III; however, low-molecular-weight heparin inhibits thrombin to a lesser degree (and Factor Xa to a greater degree) than standard heparin.4"

Given the high incidence of DVT after such procedures, prophylaxis is strongly recommended. Although a surgeon often consults in such cases, family physicians should be aware of the need for prophylaxis for DVT and should ensure that adequate therapy is provided, when appropriate. The Fourth American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on Antithrombotic Therapy has recently published a review of the complex data on prophylactic treatment for DVT, which is summarized below.6"

Although low-molecular-weight heparin costs approximately 10 times more per dose than low-dose subcutaneous heparin, it can be given once daily, which may offset some of the higher cost. While noninvasive methods of preventing DVT (i.e., use of elastic compression stockings or intermittent pneumatic stockings) are adequate in low- and moderate-risk surgical patients, low-molecular-weight heparin is an excellent therapeutic choice in high-risk patients (i.e., patients over 40 years of age, patients undergoing major surgery, patients with concurrent risk factors for DVT).6Prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin should be given subcutaneously once or twice daily until the patient is ambulating well."

Low-molecular-weight heparin is given subcutaneously twice daily, and laboratory monitoring is not required. Treatment with either warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin should be continued for a minimum of seven days postoperatively."

Five studies comparing low-molecular-weight heparin with low-dose warfarin demonstrate better efficacy with low-molecular-weight heparin.6Intermittent pneumatic compression stockings are also quite effective in preventing DVT following knee replacement surgery12; however, the number of patients studied in this trial was small compared with the number of patients in the low-molecular-weight heparin trials. No trials to date have compared the use of intermittent pneumatic compression stockings with low-molecular-weight heparin therapy and, currently, either offers adequate prophylaxis. In high-risk patients, low-molecular-weight heparin and compression stockings may be used simultaneously."

Patients who received twice-daily injections of low-molecular-weight heparin spent fewer days in the hospital and, in the studies where low-molecular-weight heparin was administered in the outpatient setting, many patients did not require hospitalization at all.17,18Furthermore, social functioning and physical activity were better in the group receiving low-molecular-weight heparin.18The dosage of low-molecular-weight heparin depends on the specific agent used(Table 2)."

The average cost of treating a patient with uncomplicated DVT is reduced by approximately $5,000 to $8,000 when using low-molecular-weight heparin instead of standard heparin therapy.

Intravenous heparin has been used since the 1940s, and physicians recognize the serious complications of treatment failure in patients with DVT. The availability and packaging of low-molecular-weight heparin provide other minor obstacles to treatment. Because low-molecular-weight heparin has been used primarily in the hospital setting, it may not be readily available through outpatient pharmacies. In addition, low-molecular-weight heparin is marketed in prepackaged syringes that contain the dosage usually adminstered for the prophylactic treatment of DVT. Consequently, several prepackaged syringes must be combined to form the larger doses needed for treatment of DVT. This step requires additional supplies and assistance from the pharmacist or home-health nurse. As low-molecular-weight heparin becomes more widely used in the outpatient treatment of DVT, physicians can encourage their local pharmacies to stock it, thus making larger vials available from which the appropriate dose can be drawn into a syringe."
