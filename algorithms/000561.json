    "abstract": "Ingrown toenail, or onychocryptosis, most commonly affects the great toenail. Many anatomic and behavioral factors are thought to contribute to ingrown toenails, such as improper trimming, repetitive or inadvertent trauma, genetic predisposition, hyperhidrosis, and poor foot hygiene. Conservative treatment approaches include soaking the foot in warm, soapy water; placing cotton wisps or dental floss under the ingrown nail edge; and gutter splinting with or without the placement of an acrylic nail. Surgical approaches include partial nail avulsion or complete nail excision with or without phenolization. Electrocautery, radiofrequency, and carbon dioxide laser ablation of the nail matrix are also options. Oral antibiotics before or after phenolization do not improve outcomes. Partial nail avulsion followed by either phenolization or direct surgical excision of the nail matrix are equally effective in the treatment of ingrown toe-nails. Compared with surgical excision of the nail without phenolization, partial nail avulsion combined with phenolization is more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrowing toenails, but has a slightly increased risk of postoperative infection.",

Because of poor visualization or instrumentation, a barb is created that anchors itself in the soft periungual tissues and penetrates deeply as the nail plate grows distally. Force during ambulation, pressure from constricting footwear, and obesity (if present) drive the nail barb penetration and worsens its severity.2"

In older persons, spicule formation can become a chronic problem caused by their reduced ability to care for their nails secondary to reduced mobility or impaired vision. In addition, the natural aging process causes toenails to thicken, making them more difficult to cut and more inclined to exert pressure on the lateral skin at the sides of the nail plate, often becoming ingrown, painful, and infected.8"

Conservative therapy provides a cost-effective approach that obviates the need for a minor surgical procedure and its attendant short-term minor disability and pain. One conservative treatment option is to soak the affected toe and foot for 10 to 20 minutes in warm, soapy water. After each soak, expert recommendation is to apply a topical antibiotic ointment (e.g., polymyxin/neomycin [Neosporin]) or a mid- to high-potency steroid cream or ointment to the affected area several times daily for a few days until resolution.12"

Dental floss inserted obliquely under the ingrown nail corner has also been found to be effective in mild to moderate cases, producing minimal, if any, pain and no secondary infection, with almost immediate relief from pain and the ability to resume normal activities.14"

A sculptured acrylic artificial nail can also be used in patients with an ingrown nail and no granulation tissue. A plastic nail platform is placed under the nail and fixed with adhesive tape. Formable acrylic is then placed on the nail and platform and molded into a nail shape to cover either a portion or the entire nail area surface. Treatment duration depends on the time required for the normal nail to grow over the tip of the toe, which is approximately two weeks to three months."

Although the use of oral antibiotics before or after phenolization is widespread, their use is based solely upon historic practice without evidence from clinical trials. Several studies have indicated that once the ingrown portion of the nail is removed and matricectomy is performed, the localized infection will resolve without the need for antibiotic therapy.18,19One randomized controlled trial with 54 patients found no significant difference in healing times between a group that received concomitant antibiotics and phenolization compared with a group that received phenolization alone over two to three weeks.1Initial treatment with oral antibiotics before surgical therapy has not been shown to decrease healing times and may delay matricectomy in moderate to severe cases, which can ultimately increase the time until clinical healing.1Physicians should strongly consider withholding antibiotic treatment and proceeding to matricectomy if conservative therapy is not an option."

Although phenolization may be the most appropriate and beneficial treatment for most patients, risks and benefits should be discussed with each patient."

The use of 20% ferric-chlorideâ€“soaked sterile cotton application for 20 to 30 seconds to the exposed nail bed has been found to reduce nail bed oozing, but carries a small risk of inducing local thrombosis.10"

Advantages of these techniques include less bleeding, reduced postoperative pain, and immediate sterilization of infected tissue. The carbon dioxide laser offers the advantage of limited thermal damage to adjacent tissues. Disadvantages include a commonly prolonged period for reepithelization and healing of the tissues by secondary intention and, consequently, local wound care for up to six weeks.22Staining of the nail matrix with methylene blue before performing a partial matricectomy with the carbon dioxide laser allows for better visualization of the nail matrix and can ensure complete cauterization.20Matricectomy via these methods is more expensive because of the initial investment of equipment costs. To date, there have been no comparative trials to examine cost-effectiveness of either conservative or surgical treatment options.9"
